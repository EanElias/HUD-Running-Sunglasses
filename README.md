# HUD-Running-Sunglasses
Wearable heads-up display (HUD) sunglasses for runners. Arduino Uno + OLED + IMU-based step detection

Purpose:
Traditional wathces require runners to look down, breaking rhythm and increasing risk. This project creates a light weight, low-cost heads-up display that projects running stats directly into the athlete's line of sight

Features:
-OLED HUD pojected onto sunglasses lens
-Step detection using MPU-6050 accelerometer
-Arduino Uno microcontroller handling display + data
-Battery bank
-Wearable-mounted prototype
